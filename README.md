# OOP PRACTICE
This TypeScript program implements a simple interactive console application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The main features include:

#Student Management:
The program allows users to add and interact with student objects.

Interactive CLI:Utilizes the 'inquirer' library to create an interactive command-line interface.

Colorful Output:Employs the 'chalk' library to produce colorful console outputs, enhancing user experience.

# Class Structure:

Student class:Represents individual students with a name property.
Person class:Manages a collection of students and provides methods to add new students.
Main Loop:Implements an asynchronous main loop that continuously prompts the user for actions until they choose to exit.

# User Options:

Talk about Students: Add new students or interact with existing ones.
Talk about Myself: Displays a predefined message about the user.
Exit: Terminates the program with a farewell message.
Student Interaction: When talking about students, the program checks if the student exists and either adds a new one or greets an existing one.

Data Display: After each student interaction, the program displays the current list of students.

This application demonstrates basic OOP concepts, user input handling, and console-based user interface design in TypeScript.
